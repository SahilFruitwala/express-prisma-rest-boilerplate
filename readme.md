# Boilerplate for NodeJS Backend using ExpressJS and Prisma ORM
This is a boilerplate code for NodeJS backend. I have used ExpressJS and Prisma as ORM. Main purpose to use prisma is we can change database easily. 99% times we have to change prisma schema only.

If you are looking for Javascript, you can use `main` or `javascript` branch. If you want typescript support go with `typescript` branch.
